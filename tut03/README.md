# Tutorial 3: Writing A Pitch Podcast Summary

### What is a Pitch
- For building a feature
- A "direction", not full-blown details
- A document showing the idea that they are after
- Why we want to add this feature
- Feedback from customers
- Mostly words (~800) and some sketches
- An attempt at a solution

### Who writes a Pitch
- Anyone can pitch an idea as anyone can come up with an idea
- Pitches written about project work are written by related individuals/individuals with the appropriate competence
- A formalized pitch is work that we are going to do
- Framing, step right before a pitch, where the problem is defined and the business value is highlighted without solving the problem
- Pitches should be written by people who can create software;
- "You cant actually have a good pitch written by someone who doesn't know how to build software; they don't know what the constraints are and what is viable

### Solution not execution
- Pitch poses a suggestion to the solution but its up to devs to actually do the work to solve the issue with defined constraints
- Pitch DOESNT HAVE what it needs to be; leads to conflicts if it did leading to situations like "it said it needed x, y, and z"
- Deferring decision of solution design until actually working on it
  -  Materials reveal better ways of doing something
- 3 Pillars of Employee Satisfaction
  - Autonomy
  - Mastery
  - Purpose
- Pitches draw on these pillars
  - You give employee autonomy to create their own solution with some broad boundaries
  - Doing the process and not asking others the solution leads to a degree of mastery
  - Part of the process of creating the solution leads to a sense of purpose
- Combination of these associated with pitch and pillars of employee satisfaction leads to more successful features

### Rabbit Holes
- Rabbit holes are things that look appealing but then you "go down the rabbit hole"
- Goes deeper and keep working but you don't get anywhere
- Usually 1 component of a feature (contrasting to science project)
- Sometimes there is something at the bottom that is necessary to get to but most times it is a trap
- Spotting rabbit holes upfront helps define trade off's that one may anticipate to help the team properly divide time and effort
- Defining what's within and out of scope helps avoid rabbit holes early

### Science Project
- Macro version of a rabbit hole
- Term for entire pitches being a rabbit hole
- Complicated with the time allocated making it hard to deliver
- Trace of Bullet: Between a Science Project and a Rabbit Hole
  - Sort of like a pitch, but unclear on how much it will take
  - Need to see where it will end up before working on it
  - Shooting multiple pitches
- Spike is another term used when you don't know if it will take 2 days or 2 weeks; unclear of time needed

### Summary
- Pitches are abstract ideas that attempt to solve an issue
- Anyone could write a pitch, but without an individual with the right competencies, a good pitch cannot be written
- Pitches don't create a solid solution, but an idea of what could be done so that employees feel involved and there aren't any creative constraints
- Defining a viable scope for the pre-defined time allocation helps reduce rabbit holes and No-Go's that could be problematic in the future
- Science projects are when an entire pitch is a rabbit hole
- Trace of Bullets is between Science Project and Rabbit Hole where one is unsure if the project is going to be a rabbit hole
