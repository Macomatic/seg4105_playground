# SEG 4105, Tutorial 1

## Brainstorming 

* PM is confusing because the 'P' can stand for different things, changing the acronym's meaning accordingly
  * P as in Product --> Deals with the business aspect and the product as a whole; usually project manager reports to product manager and is usually not technically inclined
  * P as in Project --> Deals with the development of the project and the teams associated with it; has some form of technical expertise
  * Sometimes PM is also synonymous with Product Owner --> Ensures product is meeting client expectations whilst minimizing backlog redundancy
* What I need to research
  * Specific difference in Project Manager v Product Manager v Project Owner
  * Different variants associated with Project Management e.g. Waterfall, Scrum, Agile, Kanban as these change how the Product Manager functions
* Meme Ideas
  * Should highlight the confusion associated with different PM variants
  * A meme with "identical people" but differing meanings could be good
  * Spiderman pointing meme, they all PM but different types is a good idea for the confusion associated with PM
  * The choice meme with the button and the guy sweating, but theres more than 5 options for all the Project Management options is a good idea
