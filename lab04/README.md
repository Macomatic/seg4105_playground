# Lab 4

### High-Level Description
The feature that I will be working on during the six-week cycle is designing and creating a 3D case. This case needs to be able to house the Pico Pi (single-board computer used for software functionality) whilst not hindernig its own functionality (cables should not be blocked). Furthermore, I am also going to design and implement the attachment apparatus used to attach the newly-created 3D case to any mouse. It needs to create a solid connection whilst also allowing the user to remove it and reposition it on the mouse.
