# Shape Up Summary

## Chapter 2: Principles of Shaping

When shaping, we need to have the right amount of detail; wireframes are too concrete yet using only words is too abstract. The concept associated to shaping needs to be the right amount of both abstractness, to give designers freedom of creativity/style, yet concrete in its functionality and purpose. Properties of a properly shaped idea is the following:
* It’s rough in its design
* It’s functionality is clear and solved
* It’s bounded in what it attempt to do and what it DOES NOT attempt to solve
	
Shaping isn’t done by a specific person either; programming isn’t a necessity as it is mainly a creative process. It is also hard to schedule due to its abstractness and creativity so its best to do it in isolation and when something feasible is created, present it to the team. The 4 main steps to shaping are the following:

* Set boundaries on how much time is allowed to define the problem and ideas
* Rough out the elements in a sketch or any form of higher level of abstraction
* Address risks and rabbit holes
* Write the pitch which summarizes the problem, constraints, solutions, and limitations

## Chapter 3: Set Boundaries

The appetite needs to be considered which is whether it is a small, budget project or would require a large team. Appetites come in small and large batch sizes which defines the team size and project length. They also are used as a creative constraint on the design process which is called “fixed time, variable scope”. This refers to time limitations and choosing what to fix. For example, with 2 days left, potentially prioritizing embarrassing typos is more viable than trying to fit a feature that would take 4 days. It is also important to narrow the problem and not necessarily shut down any new ideas without understanding their benefits and disadvantages. With a raw idea from shaping, a defined appetite, and a narrow problem, we can move to the next step.

## Chapter 4: Find the Elements

Now you need to move from words to a software solution which requires the right team with the right competencies. At this step, we need to also avoid ambiguity as it would get us unnecessarily stuck; we need to be concrete enough to progress on a solution. We need to answer the following:

* Where in the current system does the new thing fit?
* How do you get to it?
* What are the key components or interactions?
* Where does it take you?

In the later steps when we need to involve a designer, we need to ensure that the design is what we want and not have dialogue later like “I know I drew it like this but ignore that..”. By working at the right level of abstraction, we move at the right speed and give the designers freedom in subsequent phases of the project. However, at this phase, it is not a complete deliverable as we need to do some stress-testing and de-risking to check for future challenges. Also, we could walk away from the project at this phase.

## Chapter 5: Risks and Rabbit Holes

We need to also be aware of risks and rabbit holes that not only delay the project, but also have no apparent solution. The solution of a risk/rabbit hole should be defined enough that it shouldn’t take an extra week. However, with longer times, the appetite stretches causing a right-tailed graph. This is why we need to look for rabbit holes early and ask ourself the following questions:

* Does this require new technical work we’ve never done before?
* Are we making assumptions about how the parts fit together?
* Are we assuming a design solution exists that we couldn’t come up with ourselves?
* Is there a hard decision we should settle in advance so it doesn’t trip up the team?

We also need to be aware of solutions that we could be excited about but aren’t feasible with timwe constraints. It could be mentioned as a night-to-have but in a later phase. One needs to present it to technical experts behind closed doors to determine if “X is possible in Y amount of time” to ensure no unexpected time discrepancies. After derisking the product for rabbit holes, we can pitch it and write up a pitch.
