# Tutorial 7 Summary

## Scrum Guide Summary
- Scrum is a framework for developing and delivering products
- Scrum is lightweight, simple to understand, and difficult to master
- Scrum framework consists of teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, and rules
- Scrum was initially developed in the early 1990s for managing/developing products
- Used to develop software, hardware, embedded software, etc.
- Founded on the empirical process control theory
  - Employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk
- Three pillars upload every implementation of the empirical process
  - Transparency: significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome
  - Inspection: Users frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect undesirable variances
  - Adaptation: If an inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits and that the resulting product will be unacceptable, the process or the material being processed must be adjusted
 - Scrum prescribes four formal events
    - Sprint planning
    - Daily Scrum
    - Sprint Review
    - Sprint Retrospective
 - Scrum Team consists of the following roles
    - Product Owner
       - Responsible for maximizing the value of the product
       - Sole person responsible for managing Product Backlog
       - Orders items in backlog to best achieve goals
       - Ensuring backlog is visible and transparent
    - Development Team
       - Consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a product at the end
       - Self-organizing
       - Cross-functional teams
       - No titles for development team members
       - no sub-teams in the development team
       - Team size is small enough to be nimble and complete enough work
    - Scrum Master
       - Responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum
       - Helps Product Owner, Development Team, and Organization
  - Daily Scrum
     - 15-minute event for the development team
     - Development team plans work for the next 24 hours
     - Held at the same time and place to reduce complexity
     - Daily scrum used to inspect progress toward Sprint Goal
     - Structure is set by the Development Team
     - Example of questions that can be used during the meeting
        - What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
        - What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
        - Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?
     - The Development Team meets immediately after the daily scrum for discussions
     - Scrum master ensures the team has the meeting, but the team is responsible for conducting the scrum
     - Daily scrum is an internal meeting
     - Daily scrums:
        - Improve Communication
        - Eliminate other meetings
        - Identify impediments
        - highlight and promote quick decision-making
        - Improve the Development Team's level of knowledge

## Chapter 13: Show Progress
- Progress is sometimes hard to see
- Managers do not want to nag and always ask
- Sometimes there are no tasks left to finish, but that doesn't necessarily mean everything is done
 - Scope is predefined early
 - What if tasks within the scope/to achieve a goal are not created?
 - False illusion of completion when tasks aren't created for certain important milestones
 - ![image](https://github.com/Macomatic/seg4105_playground/assets/29697062/68b693c6-4ed3-43ee-9d75-60673842662f)
- Estimates don't show uncertainty
 - If we estimate a task and have done a similar/the same task before, its estimate is very accurate
 - If we estimate a task that is completely new, its estimate has a higher degree of uncertainty
 - Estimates don't display the level of uncertainty associated with it
- Work is like a hill
 - The uphill part is figuring out what to do; harder since it takes a lot of thinking
 - Apex is where we have a concrete idea of what needs to be done and how to do it
 - The downhill part is getting the work done; easier since we are doing something known
- Hill + Scopes
 - Mapping scopes on a hill is an easy way to see progress in a meaningful way
 - Linear scope mapping isn't accurate as it doesn't depict the early difficulty correctly
 - Helps to determine progress without asking/nagging
 - Basechart Hillcharts allow for state comparisons to show how the work is moving
 - Visually displays if someone is "stuck" based on the scope's position and lack of change in position
 - Helps to identify when a scope needs to be refactored based on its progress and movement on the chart; does it need to be broken down?
 - We can break down scopes into their tasks and also map them on a hill chart to show even more detail on progress/blockers
- Backtracking
 - Common to see scope reach apex, only for it to move back down the hill
 - Comes from uncovering an unexpected unknown
 - Often because somebody did the uphill work with their head instead of their hands, e.g. I'll just use an API
 - Hill chart is good because it lets us know the right sequence of working on stuff
 - Hard work of figuring out what needs to be down early so that the end is easy
 - Similar to the journalist's concept of inverted pyramid
