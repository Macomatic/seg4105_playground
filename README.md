# Tutorial 7 Summary

## Scrum Guide Summary
- Scrum is a framework for developing and delivering products
- Scrum is lightweight, simple to understand, and difficult to master
- Scrum framework consists of teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, and rules
- Scrum was initially developed in the early 1990s for managing/developing products
- Used to develop software, hardware, embedded software, etc.
- Founded on the empirical process control theory
 - Employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk
- Three pillars upload every implementation of the empirical process
 - Transparency: significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome
 - Inspection: Users frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect undesirable variances
 - Adaptation: If an inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits and that the resulting product will be unacceptable, the process or the material being processed must be adjusted
