# Betting Summary

## Chapter 7: Bets, not  Backlogs
- Backlogs are burdens of a project where tickets of minimal importance are in there when there is no time for them
- They are big-time wasters since they require consistent reviewing
- Holds back creativity as we see what needs to be done in the backlog rather than what can be done
- To ensure pitches dont get backlogged, a betting table happens before each six-week cycle
- Pitches are considered potential bets that are chosen from the betting table and are added to the next build cycle
- If pitches are not considered, they're instantly let go; nothing to track/hold on to like a backlog
- If the pitch was good but bad timing, they can be re-advocated for
- Decentralized lists are a good way to remove burdensome backlogs
  - Support keeps a list of requests/issues that come up more than others
  - Product tracks ideas they hope to shape in the future
  - Devs maintain a list of bugs they want to fix
  - All these lists come into play with one-on-one meetings with their departments 

## Chapter 8: The Betting Table
- Six-week cycles over two-week cycles to give meaningful time to see a project to its end whilst minimizing project overhead
- Teams consist of one designer and one/two programmers who either work on 1 big project (big batch) or several smaller projects (small batch)
- The betting table is between cycles where stakeholders choose a new pitch or an old pitch to try in the next cycle
- Output of a betting table is a cycle plan which doesn't need confirmation since the highest level people in the company were part of the betting table
- Betting table becomes a place to exercise control over the direction of the product instead of a battle for resources or a plead for prioritization
- Bets have 2 main aspects; a payout (the meaningfulness of whatever is created) and a commitment (giving the full 6-weeks to finish it)
- For it to be a bet, we can't say we're giving 6 weeks but then allocate the team elsewhere; uninterrupted time regardless of what comes up
- Circuit Breaker
  - The team needs to ship the work within the bet time. By default, the project doesn't get an extension
  - Eliminates the risk of runaway projects since we shaped the pitch with an appetite. Extra time means overloading so we use time as our circuit breaker to stop this
  - If the project isn't done in 6 weeks, maybe something was done wrong in shaping. We go back and approach it differently rather than working on a bad solution
  - Circuit breaker motivates teams to take ownership of their projects
- Bugs are addressed in the cool-down period and can be brought up during the betting table to solve in a cycle; scheduling a bug smash
- Keeping the Slate Clean: each new cycle is a new slate so it's important not to work about the past but more on the present

## Chapter 9: Place your bets
- Expectations are set for what happens during the six-week cycle
- Adding features to an existing product requires the standard Shape Up Process
- 3 Phases in the case of New Products
  - R&D Mode
    - Hard to reliably shape for a new product
    - Rather than betting on a pitch, we bet the time on spiking some key pieces of the product
    - Not expected to ship anything, the goal is to have some UI/code committed as the foundation for work
    - R&D just to figure out what's viable
  - Production Mode
    - Where important architectural decision are settled
    - Senior team brings more people to help to work in formal cycles and clear-cut shaping, betting, and building phases
    - Shaping is deliberate again
    - Team that builds is not limited to senior individuals
    - Shipping is the goal, not spiking
  - Cleanup Mode
    - There's no shaping. The cycle is closer in spirit to the "bug smash"
    - There aren't clear boundaries
    - Work is "shipped"
