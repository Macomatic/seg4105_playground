### Problem
Using a computer in the modern age can be daunting considering all the different types of inputs and shortcuts that exist. It becomes an even harder challenge when considering those with accessibility needs. The current landscape of computer peripherals is that one needs to seek out specialized products if one has accessibility needs. This is because most modern, mass-created computer peripherals have no accessibility functionality attributed to the minuscule population who would truly require it. Our capstone product aims to solve this issue by creating a mouse attachment that can be used with any mouse and can meet accessibility needs. With the software functionality created, our current problem is that the hardware we are using for the mouse attachment product has no true way of being mounted to a mouse. 

### Appetite
The time allocation for this is 6 weeks. This ensures that any work is done in a timely manner and doesn't derail the entire project as a whole. Furthermore, with the current team allocation for this, 6 weeks is ample enough time to create a viable solution; it shouldn't constrain the solution.

### Solution
We need to create a mouse attachment that can emulate keyboard inputs/shortcuts whilst also being repositionable and attachable on any mouse. Though the Pico Pi created all of the expected software functionality, we need to create a housing for the Pico Pi that doesn't hinder its functionality whilst creating the repositionable and attachable functionality. The solution to this requires the design and implementation of 2 key parts. The first part is a PLA casing for the Pico Pi that can perfectly house it whilst not hindering its functionality and ability to get power/connect to a PC. The second part is some form of connection apparatus that can physically attach the Pico Pi casing to the mouse, allow it to be removed, and repositioned on the mouse. For this, we want to explore the use of velcro and magnetized solutions.
