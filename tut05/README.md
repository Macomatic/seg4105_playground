# Tutorial 5: Betting Table Notes

## Reviewing Individual Pitches

### Chetan's Raspberry Pi Pitch
- Problem
  - Makes sense as it is essential for the entire product's functionality
  - Does need to be tackled; it is a client specification 
- Appetite
  - The indicated time frame doesn't make sense for the problem
  - Definitely can be done with less time; usually, 6 weeks time is uninterrupted and bugs are handled later but interruptions/bug fixes can happen
  - Reasoning for a 6-week timeframe makes sense if it was a feature in a sprint as it highlights research, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance
  - However, for a pitch cycle, it might not be viable for the timeframe due to being too easy to implement
  - Hard to split with a team of 4 considering hardware competencies are not shared with the entire team
- Solution
  - Good viable solution with resources to back validity
  - Easy to follow with minimal hardware knowledge 
- Rabbit Holes
  - Completely valid rabbit holes are brought up
  - Wasting time on irrelevant APIs can be a big issue so narrowing down what is important is essential for a limited time allocation 
- No Gos
  - I agree with them 
- Final thoughts
  - A good idea to work on as a feature, but I don't think it would handle being a pitch
  - With 6-weeks of work time and a team of 4 individuals, this can  be done much quicker
  - Desire for research, design, testing, and maintenance more resembles sprint features rather than a pitch
  - Definitely, something to integrate prior to the final product, but maybe not as a pitch

### Michael's Profile Page Pitch
- Problem
  - Makes sense as it is a key feature of our product
  - Seems more like a bug ticket from the description
- Appetite
  - The indicated time frame doesn't make sense for the problem
  - Definitely can be done with less time; usually, 6 weeks time is uninterrupted and bugs are handled later but interruptions/bug fixes can happen
  - Hard to split with a team of 4
- Solution
  - Seems to only tackle the frontend aspect
  - Swapping and saving also dealt with backend and endpoint integration
  - Is it really a solution that needs a 6-week, uninterrupted cycle to implement?
- Rabbit Holes
  - Makes sense not to do other non-important features of the frontend 
- No Gos
  - I agree 
- Final thoughts
  - Definitely something that needs to be done
  - Don't think it is viable for a pitch based on its scope and required time needed
  - If anything should be tackled in a sprint as a ticket/bug 

### Hong Yue's Electron Pitch
- Problem
  - Very valid problem
  - Especially with hardware components and the need to connect hardware to the web app (current implementation), the software is very needed
  - The fact that the web app is missing functionality attributed to it being a web app and not a desktop app is important to remember 
- Appetite
  - Vaid appetite of 6-weeks with a team of 4 as the entire web app + other features are added
  - Can be easily divided amongst the team as there are multiple pages and features to be worked on
  - Hardware competency, being a small division of it, can be addressed with our singular hardware member
  - 6-weeks of uninterrupted time sounds reasonable
- Solution
  - Electron is a good solution since we can use our web app react code in it
  - OS compatibility works well with our client who uses both macOS and Windows
  - UI implementation will be easy
  - Helps create enhanced hardware functionality through use of USB-A connections and potentially bluetooth
  - New features (Overlays) can be explored 
- Rabbit Holes
  - Valid rabbit hole; doesn't make sense to switch from TypeScript to JavaScript at this point
  It doesn't make sense to make massive UI differences between web app and desktop app
  - Profile's page without authentication should be explored and discussed
- No Gos
  - Valid No Gos
- Final thoughts
  - A winning pitch in my opinion
  - Valid problem that definitely needs to be solved
  - Appetite makes sense and can be divided amongst 4 members and done within 6 weeks
  - Solution helps solve the problem whilst not restricting us from exploring other aspects
  - Rabbit Holes/No Gos help restrict scope to ensure redundancies in Electron are not included (e.g. Electron features we don't need)

### Dennis' Pitch (NOT IN CAPSTONE GROUP)


## The Bet
- We did not choose Chetan's Raspberry Pi pitch since we realized in retrospect that it is not ideal to have all 4 programmers work on a single piece of hardware. Chetan is the only one who has experience with the Raspberry Pi on our team and it would make sense for him to work on it alone. The same reason we did not pick Michael's pitch on updating the profiles page: we realized it was not enough work for 4 people over 6 weeks.
- We didn't choose my 3D Modelling Pitch as the scope of what it intended to achieve did not meet with the time allocation provided. With a 4-member team working for an uninterrupted 6-weeks, the process of producing said feature would be done too quickly, making it an unviable pitch for the current cycle. This could be something we tackle as a personal ticket rather than a pitch.
- We did not choose Michael's Profile pitch since...
- As a result of The Betting Table, the winning pitch was Hong Yue's Electron Desktop App. The main reason for this is because its scope and what it attempts to solve are important for our project and viable within the allocated time. The limitation of solely using a web application is that connection to the hardware is less secure and efficient. There also is no capability to create a desktop overlay for profile switching with a web app; this was one of the client's requirements and can only achieved with the solution identified in this pitch. Furthermore, the scope of the solution can be achieved within the 6-week allocation for our team size, furthering the importance of this pitch.
